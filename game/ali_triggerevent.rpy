    p "Attention, all students! We are proud to announce that Mr. Ali has been selected to represent our school in the upcoming inter school musical competition. Let us give him the best of luck!"

    # chatter and whispers

    "The announcement echoes through the hallway. Chatters and whispers ripple through the nearby crowd."

    s1 "No surprise there. He always gets chosen whenever musical competitions are the theme."

    s2 "You’re right. I’d do anything to be in his family… He’s so lucky."

    "Ali takes out her noise-cancelling headphones, donning them to shield out the rising uproar. She  ignores them and proceeds through to the practice room."

    "Feeling the weight of their stares on her face and back, she slightly lowers her head, avoiding having to stare at people’s eyes. Students try to greet and praise her as she walks by."

    s3 "Hey, Ali! We heard the news. Congrats!"

    s4 "Good luck, Ali! You got this in the bag."

    # effect dimming (diff kinda corridor)

    "Ali’s view dims and distorts. The once sunny corridor turned gloomy and seemed tight."

    s3 "Such a show off. Always flaunting his name."

    s4 "He’s not even that good…"

    "Ali’s breath trembles as she walks past by shadows littered in the hallway. She reassures herself once she notices the sign to the practice room."

    ya "It’s okay. You’re almost there. Just keep it together…"

    "As time went by, people started to crowd and the room was filled with voices."

    yk "..."

    "Her ears started to ring and hears her heart beating through the headphones."

    "Her vision slowly starts to darken and the voices begin to whisper, hearing everything clearly despite wearing the headphones."

    r1 "Is that him? Our so-called “heir.”"

    show a upset with dissolve

    "Ali flinched when she heard her relatives subtly gossiping about her."

    r2 "I think so… can you believe it? I heard he didn’t even come close to winning his last competition."

    r3 "Rumors even say that he lost to his cousin too. And the fact that they’re fighting for the seat… Poor little boy."

    "Ali starts to tremble, her body visibly shaking. Although, no one seemed to notice. She thought to herself, squeezing her eyes shut."

    ya "… you’re wrong… I don’t want to fight. I don’t even want to be the heir…"

    r2 "The Madam must be really upset. His grandmother was rooting for him after all. I heard from an acquaintance that he wasn’t allowed to show his face until he fixed his reputation."

    r1 "Oh-ho. So his family’s influence couldn’t even save him from the humiliation, huh?"

    r3 "I mean, no wonder. People from their lineage wouldn’t want to get acquainted with a failure. Imagine my son doing the same, I wouldn’t even want people to know that I’m related to him."

    r1 "I’m surprised the Madam hasn't disowned him yet. She’s not exactly the type to give second chances. Maybe she had low expectations?"

    ya "… what…? Disowned?"

    "Ali had a sudden intake of breath. Their continued conversation was muffled as Ali tried to acknowledge what she just heard."

    "Feeling dizzy and lightheaded, she headed to the nearest balcony, wanting to escape from the gossip."

    # flashback end

    ya "… I’m going to take a breather."

    "Ali shoves her music sheet into her bag and informs her bodyguard. She rushes out of the room, seeking for a quiet place to reset her nerves."

    # a few moments later

    "Ali returned, her complexion looking better than before. Seeing as the people in the room increased, her heart beat quicker."

    "Shaking her anxiousness away, she calmly, but quickly, returns to her spot and opens her bag."

    ya "… what the— where is it??"

    "Looking through every nook and corner of her bag, she couldn’t find her anti-anxiety pills."

    ya "No no no. It can’t be missing. I-I need those…"

    "She crouched on the ground, spilling the contents of her bag to the floor. She scatters her things, frantically searching for the pills."

    "A sudden heaviness pressed on her chest. Her breath started hitching, short, rapid, shallow breaths coming out in puffs."

    ya "Please… where… why is it not here…??"

    "Her heart picked up speed, each beat louder and more forceful than the last, echoing through her head. She hugged her trembling form, trying to calm herself down."

    ya "I-it’s okay. It’s okay… Calm down…"

    ya "I can’t breathe."

    "Tears started to prick her eyes as she tried to take a deep breath. She clutched on her chest, wishing it would tame the frantic pounding of her heart."

    "She closed her eyes shut to ease the throbbing pain in her head."

    "Nearby people saw her crouched down and tried to approach her, towering over her form with a shadow."

    st "Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt? Should I call someone or the ambulance?"

    "They put their hand on Ali’s shoulder when she didn’t respond."

    ya "*gasps*"

    "When she opens her eyes, she sees a shadow enveloping her. Her vision started to darken, the world began spinning, her ears were ringing, and the throbbing headache mimicked her heartbeat."

    # flashback

    ag "How could you!? I didn’t raise you to lose to that egotistical cousin of yours!"

    "Ali’s grandmother seethed in anger as she watched her grandchild in front of her. She tightly gripped on Ali’s shoulders."

    ag "You are the heir! You shouldn't have lost, more so to that second-rate being. Tsk. What a failure!"

    ya "… I apologize, Grandmother. I will not let it happen again—"

    "In frustration, Ali’s grandmother took her anger out on her and slapped her across her face. Glaring at Ali, she started to scream her lungs out."

    ag "You better apologize! In the first place, you shouldn’t have disappointed me."

    ag "You have ruined your reputation. Bringing the company name down as well, what a failure."

    "Ali caressed her cheek with a gentle hand, flinching when it throbbed from the slight touch. She kept her head and eyes downcast. Tears stung her eyes, threatening to fall."

    ag "I gave you everything you needed. I gave you all the support… And this is how you repay me!? What an ungrateful brat you are!"

    "She towered onto Ali’s little form, her shadow darkening Ali’s world. A vicious snarl appeared on her face as she stared down at her grandchild."

    ag "Leave! Unless you fix this humiliation you brought to the family and company, you are never allowed to step foot inside this house. Do you understand!"

    ya "… yes, Grandmother. I apologize."

    "Ali bowed her head deeply, tensing her body to not let it visibly shake. She immediately left the room, tears falling down."

    # flashback end

    ya "Let go…!"

    "She swats the hand on her shoulder, a panicked expression on her face. Her face pale and her skin slicked with cold sweat."
