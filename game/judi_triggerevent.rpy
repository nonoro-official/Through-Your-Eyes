    "Judi stumbles back when she feels a body slamming into her in full force. She sees the person fall onto the ground, their things scattered around them."

    yj "Oh no! I’m so, so sorry. Are you okay? Can you stand?"

    "Judi crouches down to gather their stuff when she notices scribbles on their notebook. She looked at it for a minute when the person suddenly snatched it away."

    "They tried to run away, tripping on their feet and falling again. Judi stood stunned at the string of misfortunate events."

    "Judi noticed their clothes all wet and covered with dirt and soot. Inhaling deeply, she reached out her hand with a warm, worried smile on her face."

    yj "That was quite the fall. Here, lemme help you up."

    "Clenching their fists, the person kept their head down as Judi gathered their scattered stuff again."

    "They flinched when Judi stretched out her hand, bag of snacks dangling."

    yj "I was going to give these to my siblings, but you can have them. Feel free to throw them away if you don't like them…"

    yj "But I was hoping it'd put a smile on your face like it does on my siblings."

    "Looking in the bag, the person notices a familiar snack and scoffs."

    s "…popping candy? How is this stupid snack gonna make me happy…"

    yj "‘Cuz it's magic! Doesn’t it feel like fireworks exploding in your mouth? And the way the popping tickles your brain all the way to the tips of your fingers—"

    "Judi stops her chattering as she catches the person weirdly staring at her."

    yj "At least… that’s what it feels like for me… hehe."

    "Silence fills the air as Judi fiddles her fingers in an awkward attempt to distract herself from her embarrassment. Having enough of the awkward silence, she excuses herself out."

    yj "Anyways! I gotta go. It’s getting late and my siblings might worry. Be careful on your way home!"

    "The person watches as Judi’s silhouette slowly disappears with the sunlight. Once out of sight, they reach out for a pack of popping candy and eat it."

    "They close their eyes as they hear and feel the little bursts of explosion, a small yet noticeable smile lifting on their face."

    "Judi strolls around the school backyard, hoping to find a comfy and quiet spot to eat."

    yj "Hmm, I wonder if there’s a good spot near the storage room~"

    "Rounding the corner, Judi sees the person she bumped into days earlier surrounded by a bunch of students."

    b1 "Hey, we asked you a favor, didn’t I? So, where is it? Don’t tell me you forgot."

    s "S-sorry… things suddenly became hectic a-and I wasn’t able to finish yours in time—"

    "One bully pushed the person to the wall hard enough to cause bruises. Judi cringed as she heard the bullies raise their tone."

    b2 "Then you should’ve done ours first! Tsk, we’re gonna be enrolled in supplementary classes because of you."

    "Another poked at their head and shoulders, pushing them more against the wall."

    b3 "What are you going to do about it now, huh? How are you going to fix this?!"

    s "I’m really s-sorry—"

    "The first bully scoffed, irritated by their victim’s apologies. They raised their hand, attempting to hurt their victim."

    b1 "Sorry? Sorry?! You think that’s enough to sort this out? Ha! You must be crazy—"

    yj "Hey!"

    "Judi interrupted before the person got more hurt. Fuming in anger, she rushed to protect the victim from their bullies and covered them in her small stature. The bullies stared at her in amusement."

    yj "What do you think you’re doing? Just cause they didn’t finish “your” homework, you get to the right to raise your hand against them?"

    yj "If you guys are so adamant about passing, you should’ve done them by yourselves in the first place!"

    "Erupting in laughter, the bullies shifted their attention to Judi instead."

    b3 "Well, well, well… look at what we’ve got here. You’ve got some guts, don’t you?"

    b2 "Who are you to butt in? Their friend?"

    yj "What if I am?"

    b1 "Awww, what a sweet friendship you’ve got~ Too bad…"

    b1 "You should’ve just stayed out of this and enjoyed the show."

    "The bullies restrained Judi while she flailed around to escape their clutches. The victim saw this opportunity and ran away as fast as they could."

    "The bullies kept their firm grip, dragging her along. Then, they throw Judi inside the dark, dirty storage room."

    yj "Oof! Hey, wait—"

    "Seeing her world suddenly darken and the sound of locks clicking, she heard the grating cackles of the bullies just outside the door."

    "Judi’s mother has her hands in a painful grip on her daughter's arm, dragging her into a dark room."

    "Judi sobs as she tries to pry off her mother’s hand in an attempt to cease the pain and escape from the pitch-black unknown."

    jm "No! I’m putting you in time-out. You’ve been a bad girl, so you stay here!"

    "She tosses Judi inside the room and glares at her, irritation evident in her features."

    jm "And cease your useless crying! It’s getting on my nerves. Unless you want more time-out, you better keep your mouth shut."

    "She flinched again when another shatter shook the house. Heavy footsteps echoed around, sometimes getting louder and closer then going away."

    yj "Mom… please, stop…"

    "Her cries muffled underneath the clothes. Dried tear stains on her cheeks, exhaustion and sadness evident through her face. Sleep slowly consumed her, adrenaline whisking away."
